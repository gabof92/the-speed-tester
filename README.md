**The Speed Tester** is a lightweight Android app that measures and displays your current internet download speed in real-time, showing results on an interactive graph. The app also allows you to save speed test results for future reference and comparison, making it easy to track your connection performance over time.

>I created this app shortly after graduation (2015), while not very sophisticated in terms of architecture, I aimed to create the best user experience possible with the tools available at the time; it was relatively well received, seeing over 20K downloads and still being used a couple of years after its last update, until it was deprecated.

## Features
- **Real-time Speed Test:** Instantly test and monitor your internet download speed.
- **Interactive Graph:** Visualize speed test results on a live-updating graph.
- **Save Results:** Save your speed test history to compare performance trends.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple, intuitive UI for seamless testing and result tracking.
